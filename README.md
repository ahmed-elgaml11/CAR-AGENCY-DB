This project implements a database for a car rental agency, designed to manage customers, cars, rentals, and agencies. It includes SQL scripts for schema creation, data insertion,
and queries, reflecting my work in database design and DBMS concepts.

The CAR-AGENCY-DB project is a relational database system built to support car rental operations. It demonstrates my understanding of:
Database schema design with tables and constraints.
Query writing for data retrieval and manipulation.

you can understand what you need from explanation.md in the REPO and after restoring the database you can understand the design , chech relations , relationships, and queries
